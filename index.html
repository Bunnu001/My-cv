        <h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Mahatma Gandhi,</strong> byname of
          <strong>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi,</strong> (born October 2, 1869,
          Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi),
          <strong>Indian lawyer,politician, social activist,</strong> and writer
          who became the leader of the nationalist movement against the British
          rule of India. As such, he came to be considered the father of his
          country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of
          nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social
          progress.

          <p>
            Gandhi was the youngest child of his father’s fourth wife. His
            father—Karamchand Gandhi, who was the dewan (chief minister) of
            Porbandar, the capital of a small principality in western India (in
            what is now Gujarat state) under British suzerainty—did not have
            much in the way of a formal education. He was, however, an able
            administrator who knew how to steer his way between the capricious
            princes, their long-suffering subjects, and the headstrong British
            political officers in power.

          <h3>Mother</h3>

          <p>
            Gandhi's mother, Putlibai, was completely absorbed in religion, did
            not care much for finery or jewelry, divided her time between her
            home and the temple, fasted frequently, and wore herself out in days
            and nights of nursing whenever there was sickness in the family.
            Mohandas grew up in a home steeped in Vaishnavism—worship of the
            Hindu god Vishnu—with a strong tinge of Jainism, a morally rigorous
            Indian religion whose chief tenets are nonviolence and the belief
            that everything in the universe is eternal. Thus, he took for
            granted ahimsa (noninjury to all living beings), vegetarianism,
            fasting for self-purification, and mutual tolerance between
            adherents of various creeds and sects.

          <h2>Education</h2>

          <p>
            The educational facilities at Porbandar were rudimentary; in the
            primary school that Mohandas attended, the children wrote the
            alphabet in the dust with their fingers. Luckily for him, his father
            became dewan of Rajkot, another princely state. Though Mohandas
            occasionally won prizes and scholarships at the local schools, his
            record was on the whole mediocre. One of the terminal reports rated
            him as “good at English, fair in Arithmetic and weak in Geography;
            conduct very good, bad handwriting.” He was married at the age of 13
            and thus lost a year at school. A diffident child, he shone neither
            in the classroom nor on the playing field. He loved to go out on
            long solitary walks when he was not nursing his by then ailing
            father (who died soon thereafter) or helping his mother with her
            household chores.

          <h2>Gita</h2>

          <p>
            In the boardinghouses and vegetarian restaurants of England, Gandhi
            met not only food faddists but some earnest men and women to whom he
            owed his introduction to the Bible and, more important, the
            Bhagavadgita, which he read for the first time in its English
            translation by Sir Edwin Arnold. The Bhagavadgita (commonly known as
            the <em>Gita</em>) is part of the great epic the Mahabharata and, in
            the form of a philosophical poem, is the most-popular expression of
            Hinduism. The English vegetarians were a motley crowd. They included
            socialists and humanitarians such as Edward Carpenter, “the British
            Thoreau”; Fabians such as George Bernard Shaw; and Theosophists such
            as Annie Besant. Most of them were idealists; quite a few were
            rebels who rejected the prevailing values of the late-Victorian
            establishment, denounced the evils of the capitalist and industrial
            society, preached the cult of the simple life, and stressed the
            superiority of moral over material values and of cooperation over
            conflict. Those ideas were to contribute substantially to the
            shaping of Gandhi's personality and, eventually, to his politics.

          <h2>When Gandhi return India</h2>

          <p>
            Painful surprises were in store for Gandhi when he returned to India
            in July 1891. His mother had died in his absence, and he discovered
            to his dismay that the barrister's degree was not a guarantee of a
            lucrative career. The legal profession was already beginning to be
            overcrowded, and Gandhi was much too diffident to elbow his way into
            it. In the very first brief he argued in a court in Bombay (now
            Mumbai), he cut a sorry figure. Turned down even for the part-time
            job of a teacher in a Bombay high school, he returned to Rajkot to
            make a modest living by drafting petitions for litigants. Even that
            employment was closed to him when he incurred the displeasure of a
            local British officer. It was, therefore, with some relief that in
            1893 he accepted the none-too-attractive offer of a year's contract
            from an Indian firm in Natal, South Africa.

          <h2>Sojourn in England and return to India of Mahatma Gandhi</h2>

          <p>
            <u>Gandhi</u> took his studies seriously and tried to brush up on
            his English and Latin by taking the
            <u>University of London</u> matriculation examination. But, during
            the three years he spent in England, his main preoccupation was with
            personal and <u>moral</u> issues rather than with academic
            ambitions. The transition from the half-rural atmosphere of Rajkot
            to the <u>cosmopolitan</u> life of London was not easy for him. As
            he struggled painfully to adapt himself to Western food, dress, and
            etiquette, he felt awkward. His vegetarianism became a continual
            source of embarrassment to him; his friends warned him that it would
            wreck his studies as well as his health. Fortunately for him he came
            across a vegetarian restaurant as well as a book providing a
            reasoned defense of vegetarianism, which henceforth became a matter
            of conviction for him, not merely a legacy of his Vaishnava
            background. The missionary zeal he developed for vegetarianism
            helped to draw the pitifully shy youth out of his shell and gave him
            a new poise. He became a member of the executive committee of the
            London Vegetarian Society, attending its conferences and
            contributing articles to its journal.
